This section, the last, presents a series of examples with
complete code, which illustrate techniques for solving various
problems that arise in typesetting complex trees. Examples~1
and~2 illustrate various techniques for solving spacing problems.
The remainder of the examples illustrate the cooperation between
\pstjtree\/ and \pstnode, with its suite of macros for creating
nodes and connecting them in various ways.
